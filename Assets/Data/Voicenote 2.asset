  subtitle: "<b>Kerry:</b> I never thought how incredibly boring it is here without
    Command beaming us Datapad content. We haven\u2019t heard a response from them
    about the extraction in over a week. I\u2019ll be honest - it worries me a bit,
    but I\u2019m sure they\u2019re on their way\u2026 What worries me more is Mitch.
    He\u2019s been acting very strange lately and asking weird questions. I mean,
    I get he\u2019s stressed out about the extraction thing but\u2026 this is very
    out of character for him. Anyway, I\u2019m on harvest duty in\u2026 3 days, and
    I have nothing to do, as usual. So, I\u2019m going to do the only thing I can
    - sleep. \r"
