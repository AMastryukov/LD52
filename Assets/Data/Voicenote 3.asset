  subtitle: "<b>Donovan:</b> Something\u2019s not adding up. We sent the extraction
    request and got a response within a day. Since then, it\u2019s been dead. Not
    even a handshake. Literally radio silence. It\u2019s not like Command to do this,
    and it certainly isn\u2019t my first time but their orders are clear - await
    extraction. And Mitch has been acting weird recently. Two nights ago I woke up
    and saw him hovering over Stephanie mumbling something to himself. And today
    he asked me to give him a tour of our base like he doesn\u2019t take daily walks
    around it. Kind of strange, but I obliged - \u201CAs we exit Habitat A, you will
    see Habitat B, where our plants are grown and stored. On the right, we have the
    solar array, which powers all habitats, and around the corner to the right is
    Habitat C, where we refill the oxygen tanks for our space suits\u201D. I have
    to admit - it would have been fun if Mitch didn\u2019t take it so seriously.
    He legitimately seemed confused and intrigued, like it was his first time here.
    I\u2019m going to talk to Kerry about doing a psych eval once I come back from
    my mini trip - gonna head out to the canyon to try to send a signal from there
    just in case."
