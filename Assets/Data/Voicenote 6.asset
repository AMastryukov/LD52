  note: To grow food, I need to get fertilizer from the dispener, place it in the
    planter, get a plant from the dispenser, plant it, and set the correct water
    pressure & temperature.

  subtitle: "<b>Mitch:</b> I thought it was Kerry at first, since he\u2019s the one
    that broke the temperature sensor and water valve last week but this time I know
    Stephanie is behind this. I don\u2019t know how she\u2019s doing it but she\u2019s
    making me forget things. I had to ask Donovan to give me a tour of the base today
    because I forgot the layout. She\u2019s literally wiping my memories. This is
    not some feeble attempt to undermine my experiments, no - she\u2019s trying to
    kill the entire crew. Extraction is next week, I have to plant. Okay, plants
    take approximately one week to grow right? Yeah. I need to get the fertilizer
    from the dispenser, put it in the planter near the windows because plants need
    light. Then, I get one of the plants from the plant dispenser - A, B or C and
    plant it. Then, set the temperature & water pressure according to the right conditions
    for the specific plant. Okay, at least I remember the basics\u2026"
