  subtitle: "<b>Mitch:</b> Oh man, the rotten fruit I got in my meal two days ago
    has been tearing me up inside. Had a fever so bad last night I couldn\u2019t
    move. Thankfully, the fever has mostly subsided but I still feel a bit under
    the weather\u2026 Speaking of weather, yesterday's dust storm was pretty bad,
    apparently. Seems to have damaged the heating sensor in Habitat B so the temperature
    values are all out of whack. Thanks to Stephanie, our resident technician and
    team captain, we found that the new optimal temperatures for Plant A, Plant B
    and Plant C are 46\xB0, 53\xB0 and 58\xB0 respectively. The values are absurd,
    I know, but that\u2019s not the actual temperature, just what the sensor shows.
    Hopefully, no more rotten fruits. Can\u2019t afford it right now - we\u2019re
    running dangerously low on fertilizer. We have to ration for now but later\u2026
    Well, let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t get to that."
