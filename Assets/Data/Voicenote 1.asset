  subtitle: "<b>Stephanie:</b> Well, I finally got around to fixing the spacesuit
    stands so now we don\u2019t have to dump them on the ground or wear them all
    the time. I put them at the entrance of every single habitat for ease of use.
    Just remember to take them off as soon as you enter, I\u2019m tired of dusting
    everything. Remember - right out of the airlock, take off and stow your damn
    space suit. Just remember to put it back on when you exit\u2026 Oh, and that\u2019s
    an order"
