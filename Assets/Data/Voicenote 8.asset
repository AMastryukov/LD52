  subtitle: "<b>Kerry:</b> I hate dust storms. First, we have to prepare - go to
    Habitat B windows and close them. Then, once the storm passes, go to the solar
    array and wipe down every single panel. Oh, and if you don\u2019t? No power,
    no light, and no food for you. *pause* Uhhh\u2026 Mitch is\u2026 staring at me
    from the airlock right now. It\u2019s kind of creeping me out. Now he\u2019s
    calling me over\u2026 (to Mitch) alright, alright, I\u2019ll be right there,
    one sec, let me wrap this up\u2026\r"
