  subtitle: "<b>Stephanie:</b> A nasty solar flare hit us today\u2026 all solar power
    is down and requires a reboot. I asked Mitch to go out to the solar array to
    fix it but he just stared at me. I had to explain to him how to do it 3 times\u2026
    it couldn\u2019t be simpler than it is - just press the reset on the solar control
    panel and it will start the power back up. He gave me this\u2026 blank stare.
    Then he just\u2026 left\u2026 Donovan still hasn\u2019t returned from his trip
    to the canyon. He should have been back by now. I am starting to worry about
    him, we might need to go out and look for him, he didn\u2019t bring enough oxygen
    to last him more than 2 days."
