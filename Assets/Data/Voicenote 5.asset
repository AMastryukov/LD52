  subtitle: "<b>Mitch:</b> The water pressure valve was damaged some time last night.
    I don\u2019t know why, but the values are messed up. Took me hours to figure
    out the new pressures - 56 for A, 49 for B and 63 for C. Kerry was on harvest
    duty yesterday, and he said it was all fine when he left but I think he knows
    something that he\u2019s not telling me. Is he trying to hide something? Maybe
    he was the one who broke the temperature sensor last week and, and he\u2019s
    trying to sabotage my experiments? But why would he do that? It doesn\u2019t
    make sense\u2026 I\u2019m going to keep an eye on him just in case.\r"
