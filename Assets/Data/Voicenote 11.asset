  subtitle: "<b>Mitch:</b> My childhood friend came to visit me last night\u2026
    He said I looked pale, needed to drink more water. But I don\u2019t know\u2026
    I only saw it in a dream one time. Ah, remember the fireworks? Those were the
    days. I still hear you, tapping on the walls. Stop it. I think Stephanie\u2019s
    was more tender, but Kerry was fatter. Does that make sense? Even on a cloudy
    day? But\u2026 no\u2026 he didn\u2019t mean it. How would he know they aren\u2019t
    coming? My friend, you don\u2019t remember? He died 8 years ago. Is it my turn?
    I\u2019m gonna lie down\u2026"
